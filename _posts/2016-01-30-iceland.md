I went to Iceland in October 2015 with seven guys through an adventure travel group called Trek Brothers. We landed in Reykjavik and took a week to tour the southern part of the island. Our trip took us to Höfn on the eastern side of Iceland, and through Vik, which turned out to be quite the town for trivia.

The weather is ever-changing in Iceland, and it's not uncommon for it to be sunny, foggy, rainy, or snowy within the same hour. There is a saying in Iceland: If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes. It's true.

During the entire week we saw one police car (in Reykjavik), zero litter, and a population that was accepting, helpful, funny, and wild. Everyone spoke English. The food was ridiculously good everywhere we ate. 

Walking on a glacier, our guide, August, told us of an Iceland phrase for which there is no direct English translation: Þetta reddast. It means "it will all work out okay". He also told us how the glacier is essentially packed snow which flows down the moutnain under the weight of constantly-added snow at the peak. It pushes the ice and earth down the mountain for 400 years until it reached where we stood. Several years ago a German hiking team disappeared in the mountain. Calmly, as if it will all work out okay, August said, "The glacier always delivers."

And then there are the landscapes: almost alien, certainly surreal. This place is vast, ever changing. Drive for an hour and you may pass farmland, a volcanic eruption, ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a9494c9-9122-4d43-bf86-8b41968968bd.jpg)
